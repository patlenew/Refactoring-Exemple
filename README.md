# Refactoring-Exemple
This is a short exercice I did some time ago as a refactoring challenge of an old script I made for a really old game.
The general idea was to refactor a script called "BasicAI" that really was not that much of an AI, and turn it into a more generic
state machine.

Just note that the goal was not to add more beheaviors or add a real AI, only make the clean that was already there clean,

Here is an exemple of the beheavior in the game:
